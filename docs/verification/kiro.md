# Kiro CLI adapter verification

Maintainer-verification record for the `kiro` crewmate/scout adapter (V2 engine).
It records the active empirical facts the adapter depends on and the exact commands that establish them.
The live drift guard `tests/fm-kiro-signals-live-e2e.test.sh` (family `live-harness-optin`, control `FM_KIRO_SIGNALS_LIVE`) is what refreshes the vendor-controlled facts below; run it after every kiro upgrade.

Scope: V2 engine only (`--agent-engine v2`). The v3/KAS engine is out of scope and was not exercised: it is unsupported on this Amazon Linux 2 host and its hooks are not yet at parity.

## Environment

- Date: 2026-09-13.
- Host: Amazon Linux 2 (Linux 5.10, x86_64).
- Tool: `kiro-cli 2.21.4`, installed via toolbox at `~/.toolbox/bin/kiro-cli` (a bash sandbox shim that runs `aim sandbox --client kiro-cli`, whose descendant is the compiled bun/node binary).
- Auth: a signed-in account; auth state lives in the XDG data dir `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3`, not under `KIRO_HOME`.

## Agent-config hooks are claude-shaped (V2)

`kiro-cli agent validate --path <file>` is strict: an unknown hook trigger or a wrong value type is rejected.

```
$ kiro-cli agent validate --path config-with-hooks-stop-and-userPromptSubmit.json   # exit 0 (accepted)
$ kiro-cli agent validate --path config-with-bogus-trigger.json
Error: Json ... did not match any variant of untagged enum Repr ...                  # rejected
```

So `hooks.userPromptSubmit` and `hooks.stop`, each an array of `{"command": "..."}`, are accepted V2 triggers.
Both fired per turn in a real run (non-interactive and interactive TUI), with bare `touch` hook commands and no stdout contract:

```
$ KIRO_HOME=<per-task> kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v2 --agent firstmate --trust-all-tools --no-interactive "say hi in one word"
Hi
# both the userPromptSubmit and stop hook marker files were created
```

`stop` does NOT fire on a manual Escape interrupt (the claude behaviour), and no StopFailure/SessionEnd equivalent was found among the accepted triggers.

## Out-of-tree config via KIRO_HOME; `--agent` is name-only

`--agent` takes a NAME resolved from the global `KIRO_HOME/agents/` dir plus the workspace `<cwd>/.kiro/agents/`; a path is rejected:

```
$ kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v2 --agent /abs/path/to/config.json --no-interactive "hi"
[warn] failed to set agent '/abs/path/to/config.json': Internal error   # falls back to default
```

`KIRO_HOME` relocates the global config root (agents + settings + sessions) but not auth:

```
$ KIRO_HOME=/tmp/kh kiro-cli agent list
Global:    /tmp/kh/agents          # relocated
# /tmp/kh/{agents,settings} created; auth untouched, chat turns still authenticate
```

So the spawn writes `state/<id>.kiro-home/agents/firstmate.json` (the hook config) and reaches it with `KIRO_HOME=state/<id>.kiro-home --agent firstmate`, never writing into the worktree's own `.kiro/`.

## Trust modal and its suppression setting

`--trust-all-tools` blocks on a modal on first use:

```
Warning: Kiro is running in trust all tools mode
❯ No, exit
  Yes, I accept
  Yes, and don't ask again
```

Selecting "Yes, and don't ask again" persists exactly:

```
$ cat $KIRO_HOME/settings/cli.json
{ "chat.disableTrustAllConfirmation": true }
```

Seeding that setting into the per-task `KIRO_HOME` suppresses the modal, and a positional brief then auto-submits with no extra Enter on a fresh worktree (verified: pane showed `• ready`, both hooks fired).

## Rendered surface (V2 TUI)

- Composer glyph: `›` (U+203A), the same glyph codex draws.
- Idle placeholder: `ask a question or describe a task` (followed by a de-emphasised `↵`).
- Busy footer: `› Kiro is working · Type to steer · Ctrl+S to queue`. The delivery guard matches the harness-named `Kiro is working` literal, not the bare `esc to cancel` token kiro also renders in its tool region and shares with agy. It acknowledges a submit and gates the pending-reply delivery observation, which reads `harness=` from `state/<id>.meta`; it is never a recorded worker state.
Away-mode injection reads the PRIMARY harness instead, so it never selects kiro's signature.

## Control

- Interrupt: a single `Escape` prints `● Cancelled ...` and returns a clean idle composer with no repollution, so no clear key follows.
- Exit: `/quit` prints `Session ended.` then `Resume with: kiro-cli --resume-id <session-id>`.
- Resume: `--resume-id <id>` (id from the exit line) or `--resume` (most recent for the cwd); sessions live under the per-task `KIRO_HOME`. Firstmate automates only `relaunch` from the durable brief.

## Detection and liveness

- The live foreground process name is `kiro-cli` (`tmux #{pane_current_command}` and `ps -o comm=` both report `kiro-cli`; `aim sandbox` and the compiled binary run as descendants).
- No `KIRO_*` identity marker is exported to tool subprocesses, so detection is ancestry alone on the anchored name `kiro-cli`.

## Model and effort

- `kiro-cli chat --agent-engine v2 --list-models -f json` returns `{"models":[{"model_id":"<id>"},...],"default_model":"auto"}`; ids are bare (`auto`, `claude-opus-5`, ...). The spawn refuses a requested id a reachable listing omits and launches unvalidated with a notice when the listing is unreachable or hung.
- `--effort` accepts `low|medium|high|xhigh|max` (per `kiro-cli chat --help`), so the full shared vocabulary passes through.

## Live guard result

`FM_KIRO_SIGNALS_LIVE=1 tests/fm-kiro-signals-live-e2e.test.sh` passed on 2026-09-13 against kiro-cli 2.21.4: the busy footer matched in flight, the launch prompt was answered, both V2 hooks fired per turn, a single Escape cancelled a long turn, and `/quit` stopped the process and printed its resume-id line.
The guard's footer matcher changed after that run - it now folds the captured screen and calls the delivery guard `fm_busy_lines_match kiro` instead of a classifier helper the adapter no longer has - so that pass is evidence for the vendor facts above, not for the matcher the guard runs today.
Re-running the guard on the Linux desk where the real tool lives is what would prove the current matcher.

## What is NOT verified

- The v3/KAS engine (out of scope; unsupported on AL2, hooks not yet at parity).
- Any StopFailure/SessionEnd-equivalent hook trigger (none found). On an abnormal turn end (a stream or API error, a model-side abort) the `stop` hook never fires, so the busy record stays open and the supervisor reads the worker as provably working - deferring instead of surfacing or retiring the endpoint - until the next `userPromptSubmit` re-opens the record. The rendered footer does not rescue it: it is a delivery guard only and the classifier has no kiro pane arm.
- Primary or secondmate operation: no supervision protocol exists, and `bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses a secondmate launch.
- Backends other than tmux for the rendered surface (the portable regression drives the signals apart with real processes; the live guard exercises tmux).
